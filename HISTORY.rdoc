= RELEASE HISTORY

== 1.0.0 / 2010-08-30

This is the first public release of KO!, a BDD test framework.
KO!, or Knockout, was partially inspired by Shoulda, which served
as a nice and fairly light-weight alternative to RSpec. With
Shoulda's discontinuation, it seemed an oportune time to build a
truely light-weight next-generation BDD system.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday!
