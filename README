= KO

Knockout is  Ruby testing framework that thinks the way
a tester does.

This is KDD! This is Kickass Driven Development!


== SYNOPSIS

KO specifications... well here's an fracking example.

  Scenario "String Instance" do

    @string = "Hello World"

  end

  Feature "String Indexing" do

    Use "String Instance"

    Behavior "index of substring" do
      @string.index('H').assert == 0
      @string.index('l').assert == 2
      @string.index('ld').assert == 9
    end

    Behavior "index of regular expression" do
      @string.index(/H/).assert == 0
      @string.index(/l/).assert == 2
      @string.index(/o\ /).assert == 4
    end

  end

Get it? You create reusable scenarios --the can load libraries,
build out mocks, setup fixtures, etc. Then use use them to 
test out features.
